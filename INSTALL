INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Everything under /sbin goes in your /usr/sbin directory
Replace your default Apache site config with the one provided in /apache-config/default-site
The /usr/sbin/KohaCommander needs to be readable by your Apache user

You will also need pwauth, as well a number of Perl modules. 
Specific requirements are in flux, and documentation of dependencies will follow once things settle down.
