INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Make executable (chmod +x) and run install.sh from the folder where you downloaded Koha Commander.

You will need a few extra Perl modules regardless of your setup, eg.
	Template
	Apache2::Request, etc.

Depending on which authentication and authorization scheme you wish to use, there may be additional requirements.

If you use the default auth scheme, you will need the Perl module Authen::PAM

Specific requirements are in flux, and better documentation of dependencies will follow once things settle down.
