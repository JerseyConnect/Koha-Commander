KohaCommander - a web interface and RESTful API for managing Koha instances created by koha-common

This is a very young project. The current code represents only the barest bones, and should not be considered a functional release.

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

For an idea of what to expect as Koha Commander develops, see GOALS.txt.
