KohaCommander - a web interface and RESTful API for managing Koha instances created by koha-common

Koha Commander is intended to allow remote provisioning and management of Koha instances on one or more systems, and to extend koha-common with support for:
	- Multiple Koha instances owned by the same user
	- One-step provisioning of instances with the database on another system

This is a very young project. The current code represents only the barest bones, and should not be considered a functional release.

See INSTALL.txt for brief installation instructions.
