KohaCommander - a web interface and RESTful API for managing Koha instances created with koha-common

This is a very young project. The current code represents only the barest bones, and should not be considered a functional release.

This initial code may be the last to run as the regular Apache user, at least on a server that hosts Koha instances.
Since koha-common uses mpm-itk anyway, this shouldn't be a big deal.
